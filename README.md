# KurutsuKaren's Azur Lane webpage repository

This is the repository of my Azur Lane webpage. This page will contain the ship droprates on every ***story mode*** map. Once finished, I'll maybe add more utilities such as a Power calculator for ships.

## Language and packs

This project uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org) for running the server. Obviously I'm writing it in javascript (I'm trying to use ES6) and HTML.

At the moment I'm using this packages:
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (this is just helping with keeping the server running while changing the code)
- [nedb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) as the database

## To do
- [ ] Fill the ships database
